## Troubleshooting WebSocket/HMR Issues

If you encounter "failed to connect to websocket" errors during development, this may be due to network configuration or firewall settings. The following configuration has been added to `next.config.mjs` to help resolve these issues:

- Added CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests
- Configured webpack fallbacks for development environment
- Properly configured HMR settings

For additional issues, consider:
- Checking firewall settings that might block WebSocket connections
- Ensuring your development environment allows WebSocket connections
- Verifying that no proxy settings interfere with WebSocket connections
